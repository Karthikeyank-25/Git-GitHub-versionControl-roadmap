Branching in GitHub :
                - A branch in Git is like a separate timeline of development.
                - By default, when you create a repository, Git makes one branch â†’ usually called main (or master in older repos).
                - When you create a new branch, you can make changes without affecting the main branch until you merge them.

Commands :
1. View branches :
        ' git branch '

2. Create a new branch :
        ' git branch "branch name" '

3. Switch to a branch :
        ' git checkout "switching branch name" '

4. Create + switch in one step :
        ' git checkout -b "creating and switching branch name" '

5. Delete a branch :
        ' git branch -d "Deleting branch name" '     # delete safely (only if merged)
        ' git branch -D "Deleting branch name" '     # force delete
