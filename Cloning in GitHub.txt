Cloning in GitHub :
        Cloning means creating a local copy of a remote Git repository (from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any server).
        It downloads:
            - All the files
            - All commits & branches
            - Full history of the project
        So your local repo is a complete copy of the remote one.

Commands :

Clone the GitHub repository :
       ' git clone "repository url" '
