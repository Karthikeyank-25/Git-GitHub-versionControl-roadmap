Forking :
            A fork is your own personal copy of someone else’s repository (repo).
            You can freely experiment, make changes, or build features without affecting the original repo.

Command not needed on Git — it’s done via GitHub’s web UI:
            - Go to a repo → click Fork (top-right).
            - It creates a copy under your account.
            - You git clone your fork to your computer and work on it.

Pull Request :
            A pull request is a way to propose changes from your fork (or a branch) back into the original repo.
            It lets maintainers review your changes before merging.

Steps :
            - Fork the repo (if you don’t have write access).
            - Clone your fork → make a new branch → commit changes.
            - Go to your fork on GitHub → click New Pull Request.
            - Submit the PR → maintainers review and merge.
