Satsu is a fictional character in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics. She first appears in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight No. 1 (2007), a canonical continuation of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Buffy Summers is a slayer, a fighter of supernatural foes. Satsu is activated as a slayer, trained by Buffy, and falls in love with her. They have sex together twice before Satsu returns to Japan. In later storylines, Satsu struggles to move on from Buffy, fights demonically-possessed stuffed animals, and briefly reappears in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten. Satsu was developed by Buffy's creator Joss Whedon (pictured) and artist Georges Jeanty. Critics, fans, and industry insiders had a mixed response to Satsu's sexual relationship with Buffy. Academics have analyzed the unequal power dynamic between Satsu and Buffy, compared the representations of their sexuality, and discussed the depiction of Satsu's race and ethnicity.
