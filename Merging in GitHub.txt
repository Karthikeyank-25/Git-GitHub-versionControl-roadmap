Merging in GitHub :
            Merging is the process of combining two branches into one.
            Usually, you finish a feature/bug fix on a branch and then merge it back into main.
            After merging, the target branch contains:
                - Its own commits
                - The commits from the branch being merged

Steps for Merging :

1. Switch to the branch you want to merge into (e.g., main):
        ' git checkout main '

2. Run merge command :
        ' git merge "merging branch name" '
